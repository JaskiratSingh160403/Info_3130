                As legend has it, the NBA actually banned the first iteration of Michael's Jordans, stating they violated
                the league's rule that a sneaker must be mostly white and reflect the colors of the team's jersey. 
                Jordan was reportedly fined $5,000 for every game he wore the banned Air Jordan 1 sneakers, and Nike paid the fines,
                happy to capitalize on the publicity.But, when it comes to Air Jordans' popularity, the rest is history. 
                The shoe became a must-have status symbol of the late '80s and '90s—and it's still a street style staple today.
                Jordans made sneakers part of pop culture.

                 which remains an element in the company newer “trefoil” and “mountain” logos. Headquarters are in
